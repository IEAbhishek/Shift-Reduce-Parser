#### Shift Reduce Parser in Compiler

Shift Reduce parser attempts for the construction of parse in a similar manner as done in bottom up parsing i.e. the parse tree is constructed from leaves(bottom) to the root(up). A more general form of shift reduce parser is LR parser. 

This parser requires some data structures i.e. 
    A input buffer for storing the input string.
    A stack for storing and accessing the production rules.
